To compile with GNU g++ type "make" (on unix-type systems).
Compilation on other systems may vary. The code depends on STL lists and 
vectors.

After compilation data (almost) equivalent to figure 5A can be generated 
by typing 
"./testNT -6 1 8 NT &> NT.msg"
(omitting " of course). This gives a bunch of ascii files 
NT.-6.dat, NT.-5.dat, ... with two columns. The first column is time, the
second column is the membrane potential of the soma.
It also generates "NT.msg" containing the parameter values used.

The only difference to the figure in the paper is a very low amplitude noise 
(added in the paper but not in this code).
